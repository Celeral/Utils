 * Helper class to ensure that when more than one consumables are consumed serially,

 * subsequent consumables. The instance of this class, also helps to track various
 * consumables allocated within the try-with-resources block and to free then if the
 * try with resource block is exited unexpectedly because of an error. It also
 * prevents an unintended consumption of the consumable which need to live beyond
 * the scope of the try-with-resources block. When such a functionality is needed,
 * one needs to invoke {@link #protect()} to protect all the tracked consumables
 * from being consumed. If the protected consumables need to be consumed, one needs
 * to call {@link #expose()} to expose all the tracked consumables before invoking
 * {@link #close()}. By default, all the consumables are exposed i.e. they are in
 * unprotected state.
